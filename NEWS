SpatialPosition version 2.0.1 (Release date: 2020-04)
==============

Minor changes:  
  * Changes to accomodate sf >= 0.9 and st_make_valid no longer in lwgeom



SpatialPosition version 2.0.0 (Release date: 2019-05-10)
==============

Major changes:
* sf and sp objects are allowed as input and output (use returnclass = "sf" for sf output).  
* functions use sf for spatial computation.  
* rasterToContourPoly() (based on rgeos & sp) is deprecated in favor of isopoly() (based on isoband and sf).  
* bug fix in smoothy for some computations with NAs.  
* addition of a dataset hospital, with hospital points and capacity and Paris polygon. 
* suppression of the QGIS vignette, irrelevant in regard to QGIS v3, and not really specific to SpatialPosition

SpatialPosition version 1.2.0 (Release date: 2017-09-06)
==============

Major changes:
* Introduce mcStewart to compute stewart potentiels using parallel processing
* Introduce smoothy to compute distance weighted mean.
* Introduce a vignette on how to SpatialPosition with QGIS. 


Minor changes:  
* (Re)introduce a longlat param in stewart, mcStewart, huff and reilly to select between eucliean and great circles distances. 
* Add a bypassctrl param in stewart, huff and reilly to allow computations on large datasets
* More points in the default mask of raster poly
* Rewrite of CreateGrid and rasterToContourPoly functions



SpatialPosition version 1.1.1 (Release date: 2016-06-07)
==============

Minor changes:  
* Check mask size and validity in ratserToContourPoly
* Better SpatialPolygonsDataFrame output in rasterToContourPoly
* Default distance computation is in meters using the Great Circle distance (WGS84 ellipsoid) method.


SpatialPosition version 1.1 (Release date: 2016-03-18)
==============

Major changes:  
* Introduce the quickStewart function that outputs stewart contour polygons easily. Ratio of potentials are allowed.
* Introduce rasterToContourPoly to replace contourStewart. 
* contourStewart is now deprecated. Use rasterToContour from raster to output contour lines and rasterToContourPoly from SpatialPosition to output polygons.

Minor changes:  
* A resolution is set by default in CreateGrid.
* Vignettes are updated to reflect major changes.




SpatialPosition version 1.0 (Release date: 2015-11-30)
==============

Major changes:
* Better code for contourStewart.
* Better legend for plotStewart
* New vignette 'Stewart Potentials: a Use Case'.

Minor changes:
* Minor changes in documentation and vignette.
* Add 'cartography' in suggested packages
